Now we're going to try drawing a koala.
First, to make the koala's head, let's draw a kind of large circle.
Now, to add ears, we should sketch a somewhat smaller partial circle on each side of the head.
Good, now to make the koala's eyes, could you sketch two small circles, approximately halfway between the top and bottom of her head.
And now, to make them more realistic, let's fill in the eyes.
Now, to draw the snout, we need to sketch a smallish circle somewhat close to the bottom of the head.
It's turning out great, now to add a nose, let's sketch a longish oval shape, extending from the space between the eyes down to the center of the snout. 
Now, to create some fur, we can outline the head with some short fuzzy lines.
And now, to make furry ears, let's outline them with both long and short fuzzy lines.
Super, now, to add nostrils, we need to draw two small kind of comma shapes near the bottom of the nose.
Lastly, to make a mouth, we should fill in a small, kind of dark section below the nose.
