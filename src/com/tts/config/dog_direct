I will now direct you to draw a lion.
First, draw a large egg-shaped circle in the center of the paper, this is the head.
Now sketch a medium, partial circle on each side of the upper part of the head, these are the ears.
Next draw two small partial circles extending from the bottom of the head; this is the muzzle.
Add a wide u-shape line below the muzzle with the ends extending from the center of each partial circle of the muzzle; this is the lower muzzle.
Now sketch two small circles in the middle of the head; these are the eyes.
Sketch a medium triangle pointing down with its point meeting at the middle of the upper muzzle; this creates the nose.
Round the edges of the triangle nose; this makes it more realistic.
Now add both long and short straight lines extending out from the head; this creates a mane.
Add several small dots on each side of the muzzle; this marks the whiskers.
Lastly, fill in the eyes.
