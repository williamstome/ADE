Now we're going to try drawing a tree.
First, to start the trunk of the tree, let's start with sketching a faint line from the bottom of the paper almost to the top.
Now, to thicken the trunk, we can add straight lines that kind of slightly zigzag along the sides of the existing trunk.
It's turning out great, so now to create the base of the tree, we should add more straight lines to the bottom of the tree creating kind of like a triangle centered on the trunk.
Now, to create a ground, we should draw a few squiggles to add the area from which the tree grows.
And now to make a branch, we can use some more squiggles, angled kind of upwards, going slightly thinner the further it extends from the tree trunk.
Great, let's add a few tiny branches kind of at the top of the tree trunk.
Now, to fill in the middle of the tree, we need to add some more branches, slightly larger than and below those at the top.
Now to finish up the branches, let's add more and larger branches as we get closer to the base of the tree.
Very good, now we should draw just a few large branches at the bottom section of the tree.
Lastly, to add some shrubs and grass, we can sketch some squiggly and raggedy lines, extending from the bottom around the tree base.
