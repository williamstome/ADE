I will now direct you to draw a koala.
First, draw a large circle, this is the head.
Now sketch a medium, partial circle on each side of the head, these are the ears.
Ok, now sketch two extra small circles, halfway between the top and bottom of the large circle, these are the eyes.
Fill in the eyes.
Now sketch a small circle close to the bottom of the head, this is the snout.
Sketch a vertical oval extending from the space between the eyes down to the center of the snout, this is the nose.
Outline the head with short fuzzy lines, this creates fur.
Now use both long and short fuzzy lines to outline the ears.
Add two small comma shapes near the bottom of the nose, this makes nostrils.
Lastly, fill in a small dark section below the nose, this creates the mouth.
