Now we're going to try sketching a lion.
First, to make the lion's head, let's draw a large egg-like circle in the center of the paper.
Now to create ears, we need to sketch two medium, partial circles, one on each side the head slightly towards the top.
Next to make a muzzle, we should draw two kind of smaller partial circles extending from the center bottom of the head.
Looking good, now to make the lower muzzle, we need to make a wide u-shape line below the muzzle with the ends extending from the center of each partial circle of the muzzle.
Now to add the eyes, let's sketch two small circles kind of in the middle of the head.
Next, we'll create a nose by sketching a medium triangle pointing down with its point kind of meeting at the middle of the upper muzzle.
Great, now to make the nose more realistic, let's round the edges of the triangle.
Now to create a mane, we need to add both long and short straight lines extending out from the head.
Let's add some whiskers by drawing several smallish dots on each side of the muzzle.
Lastly, to make the eyes more realistic, let's fill them in.
