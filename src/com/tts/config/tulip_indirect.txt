Now we're going to try drawing a tulip.
First, to make the basis of the flower, let's draw a large triangle.
Now, to give the tulip shape, we should round the edges of the triangle.
Good, now to make the stem, we should add two short lines kind of off-center below the tulip.
And now, to make a leaf, we need to draw a small triangle kind of to the lower left of the tulip.
Next, to make the leaf shape more realistic, let's add a tear-shaped oval on top of the small triangle.
Very good, now to create a petal on the tulip, we need to draw a curved line through the top third of the flower.
To make a second petal, let's sketch a curved line following just outside the right edge of the tulip.
Now to make the flower more realistic, let's outline the bottom of the tulip with a kind of curvy line.
It's turning out great, now we need to extend the stem using a slightly curved line to the bottom of the paper.
Lastly, let's add a second leaf extending to the right of the stem.
