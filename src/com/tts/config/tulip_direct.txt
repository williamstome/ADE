I will now direct you to draw a tulip.
First, sketch a large triangle; this will be the flower.
Now round the edges of the triangle; this will make the tulip shape.
Ok, add two short lines off-center below the tulip; this will make the stem.
Add a small triangle to the lower left of the tulip; this will be a leaf.
Now draw a tear-shaped oval over the small triangle; this will make the leaf realistic.
Draw a curved line through the top third of the tulip; this defines a petal.
Add a curved line following the outer right edge of the tulip; this will create another petal.
Now use a curvy line to outline the bottom of the tulip; this will make the flower more realistic.
Extend the stem using a curved line to the bottom of the paper.
Lastly, add a second leaf extending to the right of the stem.
