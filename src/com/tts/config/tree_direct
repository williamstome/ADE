I will now direct you to draw a tree.
First, sketch a line from the bottom of your paper almost to the top; this is the tree trunk.
Now add straight lines that zigzag along the sides of the trunk; this will thicken the existing trunk.
Ok, now add more straight lines to the bottom of the tree creating a triangle centered on the trunk; this will create the base of the tree.
Now draw a few squiggles around the base of the tree; this will be the ground.
Draw a branch by using squiggles angled upwards, going thinner the further it extends from the tree trunk.
Add tiny branches at the top of the tree trunk.
Now add more branches, larger than and below those at the top.
Add more larger branches closer to the base of the tree.
Now draw a few large branches at the bottom section of the tree.
Lastly, sketch some squiggly and raggedy lines, extending from the bottom around the tree base; this will create shrubs and grass.
