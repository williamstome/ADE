1 TTS Component 
================
The ademary TTS component is an ADE wrapper of some of the core functionalities of MaryTTS. 
There is the option to use prosody with the voice. These options can be passed to the server 
in the form of command line flags, including:
-stress     make voice sound stressed/nervous/jittery
-anger      make voice sound angry
-confusion  make voice sound confused
-male       use male voice
-female     use female voice

2 Demo Configuration
================
To run a quick standalone demo of this component, first build the necessary
ADE components:

$ ./ant tts utilities

then run:

$ ./ant run-registry -Df=config/marytts-demo.config

This will start the MaryTTS component along with a
GUI from which you can set prosody with "setEmotion" ("stress", "anger", 
or "confusion") and enter strings to say via "sayText".
